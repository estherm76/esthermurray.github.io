        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I go to the University of Illinois, where I study computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got interested in computer science after going to a camp during high school where I did group projects with Arduino boards. It was a lot of fun.
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up in Portland, Oregon and I have parents, siblings, and a dog.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a portrait of me.
